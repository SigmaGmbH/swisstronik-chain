License FAQ
The Swisstronik Non-Commercial License 1.0 (SWTR-NCL-1.0) was created by Sigma Assets GmbH (Swisstronik) to create a mutually beneficial balance between the interests of users of our open software, which offers free and open access to the entire product code modifications, distribution, auditability, etc., as well as the sustainability requirements for our software developers to continue to deliver product innovation and maintenance.
SWTR-NCL-1.0 is structured to allow free use in all non-commercial use cases and limited commercial use cases.
SWTR-NCL-1.0 grants users full access to the source code, allowing users to modify, distribute and extend it within permitted uses.
This FAQ is intended to answer questions from developers and companies interested in developing or commercializing SWTR-NCL-1.0 software.


Q: What is Swisstronik Non-Commercial License 1.0 (SWTR-NCL-1.0)?
A: SWTR-NCL-1.0 is an alternative to closed source or fully open source licensing models. Our licensing model includes open source elements under GPLV3 and source-available elements under SWTR-NCL-1.0. Under SWTR-NCL-1.0, source code is always publicly available. You have the right to "use, modify and redistribute" the Software for any non-commercial purpose or certain commercial purposes.
Implicitly there is only one major limitation. You may not use the Software for commercial purposes unless the commercial use is on a designated blockchain or you have obtained prior commercial authorization.
The right to "use" here includes forking and using SWTR-NCL-1.0 code as code dependencies, since using dependencies does not violate SWTR-NCL-1.0.
The following is the specific language of the license:
"Software" means the blockchain software developed by the Company, which is an implementation of the Swisstronik blockchain, available at "https://github.com/SigmaGmbH/swisstronik-chain", as updated from time to time.

"Specified blockchain" refers to a version of the digital blockchain ledger that is recognized as canonical at a specific point in time based on blockchain consensus. The blockchain originally envisioned was the Swisstronik blockchain, identified by the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 155 (EIP-155) chain identifiers 1291-1 (testnet or "testnet") and 1291 (mainnet or "mainnet").

"Swisstronik Product" means any product or service provided by Company or its affiliates.

"Non-commercial use" means academic, scientific or research & development use or evaluation of the Software (e.g. through auditing), but does not include the creation of publicly accessible blockchains, precompiled smart contracts or other distributed ledger technology systems, making any transaction of economic value possible.

"Commercial use" means any use that does not constitute a non-commercial use.

"Use" means any use, modification, distribution or other exploitation of the Software or portions thereof.

Q: What is the purpose of SWTR-NCL-1.0?
A: Create a license that strikes a balance between maintaining sustainable software development and supporting the original principles of open source, enable all non-Swisstronik electronic software developers to be part of the innovation cycle - provide them with open access to the code , so that they can make all source code available from the beginning to review, modify, or distribute the software. Please note that SWTR-NCL-1.0 has not yet been approved by OSI and we do not refer to it as an open source license.
Q:How can I ask questions about the terms of this license, get alternate licensing terms, or apply for a commercial use permit?
A: Point of contact for all legal inquiries is: legal@swisstronik.com. They can help you to clarify software usage or resolve any issues related to SWTR-NCL-1.0.
Q: What if I am currently using Swisstronik code commercially in my business/project?
You are allowed to continue using the code from older versions (<v1.0.7) of Swisstronik repository under LGPL 3.0, however, you must obtain a commercial permit from the licensor for commercial use not allowed under SWTR-NCL-1.0, for version v1.0.7 and onward.
Q: What is a License and Copyright Notice?
A: You have to include the license and copyright notice with the software when you distribute it. This duty applies to everyone who obtains a copy of the software from you, not just the licensee. This is required to ensure that the license terms of the program are understood by all receivers. Eliminating copyright or licensing notices is a major offense and a breach of the agreement. This means that in addition to the software, you have to make sure that anyone who obtains a copy from you also gets a copy of the licensing terms or a link to the license, along with any plain-text lines that start with "Required Notice" that were supplied by the licensor.
For example:
"Required Notice: Copyright Sigma Assets GmbH (Swisstronik) (https://github.com/SigmaGmbH)"
Q: Do I need a commercial permit when testing SWTR-NCL-1.0 software?
A: No, non-commercial use (such as use, modification, and distribution) is expressly permitted by SWTR-NCL-1.0.
Q: Which copies of the software do I need a commercial permit for if I have one copy for business use and other copies that I solely use for personal use?
A: Unless they are operating on the Designated Blockchains, copies of the software that are being used for business purposes are the only ones that require a commercial permit. Details on the relationship between the two licenses will be included in any business permit that you negotiate with us.
Q: What happens if Sigma Assets GmbH decides later on to modify the use restriction?
A: You will always be permitted to use any prior version of the SWTR-NCL-1.0 software in accordance with the terms that were in effect at the time of release, although a licensor may alter the usage limitation in subsequent releases. Stated differently, the licensor's modifications would just pertain to the future and not be applicable in the past.
Q: What will occur if I combine SWTR-NCL-1.0 code with other code?
A: The SWTR-NCL-1.0 restrictions will still apply to the SWTR-NCL-1.0 portion of the code. Code surrounding it is unaffected by the license, unlike what LGPL or GPL might do.
Q: Can I use SWTR-NCL-1.0 software in an Open Source project?
A: No, using open source software with the usage constraint of the SWTR-NCL-1.0 is not permitted. The SWTR-NCL-1.0 code has a usage restriction that can be removed by getting a commercial permit from Swisstronik; nevertheless, we will not allow you to distribute the code under an open source license.
Q: Can I use SWTR-NCL-1.0 code in the code base for my commercial, closed-source product?
A: No, unless you can guarantee adherence to the restrictions in SWTR-NCL-1.0 or you have secured a commercial permit for the SWTR-NCL-1.0 code.
Q: Can I share my modified version of software under an Open Source license, such as MIT or Apache 2.0, if I make changes to the source code licensed under SWTR-NCL-1.0?
A: No. The original software, which is licensed under the SWTR-NCL-1.0, and your changes together make up your modified version, which is a derivative work of the original software. You are not allowed to redistribute under a permissive license by virtue of the license. On the other hand, a combined software including elements covered by each license may be distributed. That is permitted by both permissive and SWTR-NCL-1.0 licenses.
Q: Can I create software that will be licensed under different licenses using SWTR-NCL-1.0 products?
A: Yes, provided that the SWTR-NCL-1.0 code is not included into the code of the product under development and that the licensing requirements are not violated by using the SWTR-NCL-1.0 code for commercial purposes.
Q: Is it possible to backport any SWTR-NCL-1.0 code to a previous, open-source version of the software?
A: No. In this case, you would either be breaking the license of the open source project by introducing incompatible SWTR-NCL-1.0 code (i.e., code subject to a use limitation not permitted by the license of the open source project) or breaking the copyright of the SWTR-NCL-1.0 licensor by re-releasing the code under open source.
